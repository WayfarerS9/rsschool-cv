## About me:
Year of birth: 1985
I am a passionate software engineer looking for an entry-level position. My previous career was not related to coding, but after getting information about programming and attending initial courses, I was really excited and decided to radically change my professional activity.
Thanks to my previous career, I improved interpersonal and communication skills, problem solving and negotiation skills, planning and organizing skills. Besides I am highly adaptable to ever changing circumstances.
I have deep knowledge in a jurisprudence (especially in the economic law), financial and economic activities of enterprises, which I can effectively use being involved in projects related to these areas.
